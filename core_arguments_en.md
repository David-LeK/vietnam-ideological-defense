**1. On Marxism-Leninism and Ho Chi Minh Thought:**

**Allegation:** Claims that Marxism-Leninism is obsolete, backward, and only suitable for the 19th century; the collapse of the Soviet Union proves this theory is erroneous; and that it must be abandoned to follow a different path.
* Marxism-Leninism is not obsolete because it discovered the objective laws of motion of history and society.
* The nature of capitalism (exploitation, contradictions) still exists exactly as Marx predicted.
* The collapse of the Soviet Union was due to erroneous application, dogmatism, and the betrayal of the leadership, not due to the fault of the theory itself.
* It is necessary to be steadfast and creatively apply Marxism-Leninism to the practical conditions of Vietnam.
* Marxism-Leninism is an open theory that constantly develops, taking practice as the standard of truth.
* The humanistic value of the theory is the liberation of humanity, the comprehensive development of people, moving humanity from the "realm of necessity" to the "realm of freedom."

**Allegation:** Denies the theory of surplus value, claiming that in the knowledge economy and Industry 4.0, machines and technology create value, not labor; capitalism no longer exploits.
* Machines and technology, no matter how modern, are only means of production (past labor); they transfer value to products but do not create new value.
* Only human living labor (becoming increasingly intellectual) creates new value and surplus value.
* The exploitative nature of capitalism has not changed, it has only become more sophisticated; the polarization of wealth globally is deepening.

**Allegation:** Attempts to separate Ho Chi Minh Thought from Marxism-Leninism, claiming Vietnam only needs Ho Chi Minh Thought; pits the two against each other to deny the Party's foundation.
* Ho Chi Minh Thought is the creative application and development of Marxism-Leninism to Vietnamese conditions; the two are dialectically unified and inseparable.
* Denying Marxism-Leninism inevitably leads to a misunderstanding and distortion of Ho Chi Minh Thought.

**Allegation:** Claims that Ho Chi Minh Thought is merely "nationalism"; that Ho Chi Minh only "borrowed" Marxism-Leninism as a tool for national liberation, or blindly copied it; attempts to separate or oppose Ho Chi Minh Thought to Marxism-Leninism.
* Ho Chi Minh Thought is a creative application and development of Marxism-Leninism adapted to the specific conditions of Vietnam; it is a dialectical unity of class liberation, national liberation, and human liberation.
* Historical reality proves that purely nationalist movements (like those of Phan Boi Chau, Phan Chau Trinh) failed; only when combining patriotism with Marxism-Leninism did the revolution succeed.
* Ho Chi Minh did not copy dogmatically; he absorbed the essence of humanity (East and West) on the basis of the Marxist worldview to find a unique path for the Vietnamese revolution.

**Allegation:** Distorts Ho Chi Minh's private life and biography (fabricating stories, claiming he had a wife/children, etc.) to "dethrone the idol" and lower his moral prestige.
* These are malicious fabrications, lacking historical basis, aiming to attack the spiritual symbol of the Party and the people.
* UNESCO honored President Ho Chi Minh as a "Hero of National Liberation and a Great Man of Culture of Vietnam," confirming his noble values and contributions to humanity.
* The moral example of Ho Chi Minh (industriousness, thrift, integrity, uprightness, public-spiritedness) is a recognized fact, acknowledged by both the Vietnamese people and the world.

**2. On the path to Socialism:**

**Allegation:** Claims that Vietnam's steadfastness in the goal of national independence associated with Socialism is a mistake, following the "failed tracks" of the Soviet Union; demands the abandonment of Socialism to follow the capitalist path.
* National independence associated with Socialism is the inevitable choice of history and the Vietnamese people, proven through the victories of the revolution.
* Socialism is a superior, humane regime aimed at human liberation.
* Vietnam's "Doi Moi" (Renovation) is not a change of color, but a more correct awareness of Socialism. The achievements of 30 years of renovation prove the correctness of this path.

**Allegation:** Claims that "if Vietnam had followed the capitalist path, it would be as developed as the 'Asian Dragons'"; asserting that the chosen path has led the nation into a "dead end" and poverty.
* Before the Communist Party, patriotic movements following the bourgeois or feudal paths in Vietnam all failed. History proved that only the path of proletarian revolution could regain true independence.
* Comparisons must consider specific historical, political, and social contexts. Vietnam had to undergo devastating wars to regain independence, unlike some other nations that developed under different conditions.
* The nature of capitalism is exploitation and inequality; selecting Socialism is choosing a path of sustainable development, ensuring social progress and justice for the majority, not just a wealthy minority.

**3. On the Economy:**

**Allegation:** Claims that a "market economy" cannot go hand-in-hand with a "socialist orientation"; the market economy belongs to capitalism; and that Vietnam is actually developing along the path of capitalism enthusiastically.
* The market economy is an achievement of human civilization, not a product exclusive to capitalism.
* The socialist-oriented market economy is the general economic model of the country: it both follows market laws and has State management to ensure social equity and the goal of a wealthy people and a strong country.
* There is no "pivot" to capitalism, but rather the utilization of the market economy to build Socialism.

**Allegation:** Demands the abolition of the leading role of the state economy, claiming it is inefficient and crowds out the private sector.
* The state economy is a vital material tool for the State to direct and regulate the macro-economy, correct market failures, and ensure social welfare and national defense-security.
* The leading role does not mean occupying the largest proportion, but holding key positions, leading the economy, and creating conditions for other sectors to develop.
* The leading role of the state economy does not eliminate competition but promotes equal competition; state-owned enterprises operate under market mechanisms and handle areas the private sector cannot or will not undertake.

**Allegation:** Claims that developing the private economy is "capitalization" and deviating from Socialism; that the private economy will create "crony capitalism" and overshadow the State's role.
* The private economy is defined as "an important driving force" of the economy, helping to liberate productive forces, create jobs, and contribute significantly to GDP.
* Developing the private economy goes hand-in-hand with perfecting institutions, laws, and State management, ensuring the socialist orientation, not "capitalization."
* The State resolutely fights against "group interests" and "backyard" companies, ensuring a healthy competitive environment; the state economy maintains its leading role in guiding the economy.

**Allegation:** Distorts the statement "money among the people is still abundant" as a plot to "change currency," "confiscate assets," or force people to buy bonds; sows fear to make people withdraw bank deposits and hoard gold.
* The State's policy is to encourage people to shift capital from hoarded assets (gold, foreign currency) to productive investment through official, transparent channels to develop the economy.
* Citizens' legal property rights are absolutely protected by the Constitution; there is no such thing as "currency change" or confiscation.

**4. On Political Institutions (Pluralism, Multi-party system):**

**Allegation:** Claims that to have democracy and development, there must be political pluralism and opposition parties; a one-party system is dictatorial and undemocratic.
* A multi-party system is not synonymous with democracy (in reality, many multi-party countries remain unstable and underdeveloped).
* The sole leadership of the Communist Party of Vietnam is chosen by history and acknowledged by the people.
* The Party is the ruling party, representing the interests of the entire nation, so pluralism and a multi-party system are neither necessary nor accepted.
* Socialist democracy is a substantive democracy where power belongs to the people.
* Historical practice in Vietnam (1945-1946 period) and the world shows that a multi-party system does not guarantee stability and development, and can even cause political chaos.

**Allegation:** Claims that only a multi-party system brings democracy, while a one-party system is inevitably dictatorial and undemocratic.
* A multi-party or one-party system does not determine the nature of democracy; what matters is whose interests the party represents (the majority of the people or a minority of owners).
* In reality, many multi-party countries still have power concentrated in the hands of capitalist corporations (formal democracy); Vietnam has one party but ensures power truly belongs to the people.

**Allegation:** Demands a multi-party system to "respect differences"; claims that a one-party system eliminates differences and criticism.
* Respecting differences does not mean accepting opposition political organizations that cause division and instability.
* Vietnam respects constructive differences of opinion within the framework of the law and the common interest of the nation. The mechanism of social criticism through the Fatherland Front and socio-political organizations is becoming increasingly substantive and effective.

**5. On the principle of Democratic Centralism:**

**Allegation:** Claims that the principle of democratic centralism is obsolete, leading only to bureaucratic centralization, arbitrariness, and authoritarianism; and that this principle needs to be abolished.
* Democratic centralism is the fundamental organizational principle, the "backbone" of the Communist Party and the Socialist State.
* It ensures unity of will and action while promoting collective wisdom.
* Mistakes (if any) are due to the incorrect implementation of the principle, not because the principle itself is wrong. It is necessary to fight against both bureaucratic habits and anarchic freedom.

**6. On the Armed Forces (Military, Police):**

**Allegation:** Demands the "depoliticization" of the armed forces; claims that the military and police must be "neutral," serving only the Fatherland/State, not serving any political party.
* This is a malicious plot aimed at stripping the Party of its leadership over the armed forces (like the bloody lesson of the Soviet Union).
* The Military and Police bear a class nature; there is never absolute "neutrality."
* The Vietnamese armed forces must be placed under the absolute, direct leadership of the Party in all aspects to protect the Party, the State, the regime, and the People.
* The lesson from the collapse of the Soviet Union shows that "depoliticizing" the military (abolishing the party committee and political commissar mechanisms) was the direct cause that paralyzed combat power, leading to the loss of the regime.

**Allegation:** Pits loyalty to the Party against loyalty to the Fatherland and People; claims the military only needs to be "loyal to the Country, filial to the People."
* This is a tactic to separate the Military from the Party's leadership. In Vietnam, the interests of the Party, State, and People are unified; loyalty to the Party is loyalty to the Country and the People.
* President Ho Chi Minh affirmed: "Our army is loyal to the Party, filial to the people."

**Allegation:** Distorts that the armed forces cooperate with foreign militaries (e.g., the US, UN peacekeeping) as losing their revolutionary nature, becoming "mercenaries", or depending on imperialists.
* International defense cooperation is a consistent policy of multilateralization and diversification to protect the Fatherland early and from afar, not "losing one's nature."
* Participating in UN peacekeeping demonstrates Vietnam's responsibility to the international community, elevating the country's position, and is completely different from being "mercenaries."
* The "Three Nos" defense policy ensures independence and autonomy; cooperation does not mean entering military alliances or opposing third parties.

**7. On National Defense - Security:**

**Allegation:** Claims that in the conditions of high-tech warfare, the line of "all-people national defense" and "people's security" is backward and wrong.
* High-tech weapons, though powerful, are not a panacea; humans are the decisive factor.
* The line of all-people national defense and people's war is the unique military art of Vietnam: using the small to defeat the large, using the few to oppose the many.
* Building a solid "posture of the people's hearts" is the core to protecting the Fatherland against all types of warfare.
* High-tech weapons have limitations: high costs, dependence on terrain, weather, and human factors; they cannot replace the combined strength of a people's war.
* Political and spiritual potential is the decisive factor for victory in a war to protect the Fatherland, even when the adversary uses high-tech weapons.

**8. On Civil Society:**

**Allegation:** Promotes "civil society" according to Western criteria, viewing it as a counter-weight force to the State; exploits non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and associations to oppose the regime.
* The nature of the "civil society" ploy by hostile forces is to form opposition political organizations that break away from the Party's leadership.
* Vietnam respects the right to form associations, but this must be within the framework of the law and placed under the leadership of the Party and the management of the State.
* It is necessary to clearly identify and fight to prevent the exploitation of "civil society" to transform the political regime.

**9. On Anti-Corruption:**

**Allegation:** Claims that the Communist Party cannot successfully fight corruption because it is a "systemic error" of the one-party regime; asserts that only a separation of powers can fight corruption.
* Corruption is a congenital defect of power, existing in every regime (both multi-party and one-party).
* The institution of "separation of powers" is not the only or universal cure for corruption.
* The Party has high political determination and has been implementing synchronous solutions (party building and rectification, perfecting laws, promoting the role of the people) and has achieved important initial results.
* In reality, countries implementing "separation of powers" still have serious corruption; effective anti-corruption depends on strict power control mechanisms and the self-cultivation of officials.

**Allegation:** Claims corruption is a "congenital defect" or "systemic error" so fighting it is useless, one must "learn to live with it"; or that fierce anti-corruption efforts will "paralyze" supply chains and hinder development.
* Corruption is a defect of power in any regime, but it must not be accepted; power must be controlled by mechanisms ("caging power in the cage of regulations").
* Reality proves that fighting corruption helps the economy develop healthily and sustainably (GDP continues to grow high), not paralyzing the economy as distorted.
* Strict handling serves as a deterrent, "punishing one to save thousands," strengthening the trust of investors and the people.

**Allegation:** Claims that anti-corruption efforts are merely "internal purges", "power struggles", or "factional elimination" aimed at consolidating power before the Party Congress.
* The anti-corruption campaign is transparent, objective, and follows the principle of "no forbidden zones," aimed at purifying the Party and State apparatus, not for personal or factional gain.
* Allegations of "infighting" are malicious fabrications intended to divide internal unity and erode public trust in the Party's determination.

**Allegation:** Claims that focusing too much on anti-corruption discourages innovation, makes officials fear making mistakes and evade responsibility, thereby holding back economic development.
* Anti-corruption does not discourage genuine officials, only those with impure motives or who have committed violations.
* Cleaning up the apparatus removes "tumors", creating a transparent environment favorable for economic development; actual economic growth proves that anti-corruption does not paralyze the economy.
* The Party has issued mechanisms to protect officials who "dare to think, dare to do" for the common good. The situation of evasion is mainly due to limited capacity or legal overlaps, which are being actively addressed.

**10. On Foreign Affairs:**

**Allegation:** Denies the foreign policy of independence and self-reliance; calls for military alliances with one country to oppose another; criticizes the "Three Nos" policy of Vietnam's national defense.
* Vietnam's foreign policy is one of independence, self-reliance, peace, cooperation, and development; multilateralization and diversification.
* The "Three Nos" policy (no military alliances, no foreign bases on Vietnamese soil, no allying with one country to counter another) helps Vietnam maintain sovereignty and a peaceful environment.
* Military alliances would result in the loss of autonomy and turn the country into a backyard or a battlefield for major powers.

**Allegation:** Claims that deep international integration will lead to a loss of independence and autonomy; or that one cannot maintain independence while integrating.
* International integration and independence/autonomy have a dialectical, complementary relationship. Integration strengthens internal resources (economy, defense) to better protect independence and sovereignty.
* Vietnam maintains the principle of independence and self-reliance in all integration decisions, not being dominated by external forces.

**Allegation:** Incites Vietnam to "choose a side" in major power competition; claims that not joining military alliances is self-isolation and fails to protect sovereignty.
* Vietnam steadfastly pursues a foreign policy of independence and self-reliance, choosing justice, righteousness, and national interests rather than choosing sides.
* "Bamboo diplomacy"—flexible and adaptable but principled—helps Vietnam maintain balance, attract resources for development, and protect peace.
* History proves that relying on foreign powers often leads to dependence and turning the country into a pawn in the calculations of major powers.

**11. On the Press, Literature, and Arts:**

**Allegation:** Demands absolute "freedom of the press" and "freedom of creativity"; denies the Party's leadership over literature and arts; demands the privatization of the press.
* There is no absolute, classless freedom of the press or arts anywhere.
* The Party's leadership ensures that the press and arts serve the interests of the nation and the people, oriented toward the true, the good, and the beautiful.
* Struggle against views that commercialize, trivialize, or exploit arts and the press to oppose the regime.
* Freedom of the press and creativity must be within the framework of the law and social/civic responsibility; there is no absolute freedom or standing outside of politics.

**12. On "Self-evolution" and "Self-transformation":**

**Allegation:** Claims that "Self-evolution" and "Self-transformation" are inevitable laws that the Party cannot prevent; or denies their existence.
* Resolution of the 4th Plenum of the 12th Central Committee clearly identified specific manifestations of degradation, "self-evolution," and "self-transformation."
* This is a danger threatening the survival of the regime that must be resolutely fought.
* It is a very short step from moral degradation to political degeneration; it must be prevented early through synchronous political, ideological, and organizational solutions.
* Lesson from the Soviet Union: The ideological, political, and moral degradation of a section of high-ranking leaders was the main cause leading to the collapse of the Party and the regime.

**13. On Streamlining the Apparatus and Implementing the Two-tier Local Government Model (from July 1, 2025):**

**Allegation:** Claims that streamlining the apparatus is merely "old wine in new bottles", shifting people from one place to another without substance; asserts that the police and military are not streamlining but expanding; claims it causes unemployment and instability.
* This is an organizational revolution aiming for "Lean - Compact - Strong - Efficient", not a formality. The Ministry of Public Security pioneered this (abolishing General Departments), operating more effectively, proving "no forbidden zones".
* The arrangement is calculated scientifically with a roadmap, ensuring policies and support for redundant staff; it is not an inhumane purge.
* The goal is to reduce recurrent expenditures to save resources for development investment (infrastructure, social welfare) and better service to the people.

**Allegation:** Distorts that this model is "concentration of power", "purging of factions", "abolishing administrative levels" causing a loss of democracy and weakening grassroots management; falsely accuses the State of not consulting the people; incites dissatisfaction regarding staff downsizing.
* Streamlining the apparatus is an objective and urgent requirement to improve operational effectiveness and efficiency, overcoming the situation of a cumbersome machinery and intermediate levels that cause waste and hinder development.
* This is a consistent policy, supported by the people, aimed at expanding development space, promoting regional connectivity, and improving the business investment environment.
* The two-tier model helps simplify administrative procedures, bringing the government closer to the people to timely resolve their rights and interests, rather than causing a loss of democracy.
* It contributes to building a lean, transparent, and dynamic apparatus, promoting civil service reform and the construction of a Digital Government and e-Government.
* Allegations of "purges" or "lack of public consultation" are fabrications aimed at dividing the great national unity.

**Allegation:** Claims that merging units "erases" local culture, history, and identity; or that the temporary increase in deputies means "streamlining leads to bloating" and waste.
* Adjusting administrative boundaries does not erase history or culture (preserved in communities and records); new names follow democratic processes and inherit historical values.
* The increase in deputies is only a humane, transitional measure for a short period (max 5 years) to avoid disruption, reducing over time; overall staffing and budget expenditures decrease significantly.
* Mergers allow resource concentration for infrastructure, cultural preservation, and improved public services (digital transformation ensures distance is not an obstacle).
* Resources saved from streamlining the intermediate apparatus (district level) will be focused on social welfare (such as healthcare, free tuition), bringing practical benefits to the people.

**Allegation:** Distorts that streamlining the apparatus is an opportunity to "reduce troops", "depoliticize the military" due to Western pressure or "lack of combat targets"; claims this is a "factional purge" to consolidate personal power.
* Streamlining is an internal policy aimed at improving combat strength and efficiency, not under pressure from any outsider.
* The military is built towards "lean, compact, strong" and modernization to protect the Fatherland in the new situation, not "reducing troops" due to lack of missions.
* The arrangement is based on democratic centralism and national interest, absolutely not a personal or factional plot.

**Allegation:** Claims that the streamlining is merely the "subjective will" of leaders to "consolidate power" or "purge opponents"; asserts that "merging will eventually lead to splitting again" causing instability.
* Streamlining is not a subjective will but an objective requirement of the revolution and a consistent Party policy based on Marxism-Leninism ("Better Fewer, But Better").
* It is an urgent economic necessity: currently, nearly 70% of the budget is for recurrent expenditure (salaries, operations); streamlining is required to free up resources for development investment, national defense, and social welfare.
* The apparatus must be flexible and suitable for each development stage; maintaining a cumbersome machinery hinders the country's rise in the new era.

**Allegation:** Distorts that the support policy for officials retiring early (Decree 178) is unfair, "excessively favoring" them compared to laborers, causing internal division.
* This is a specific, humane policy to encourage officials who suffer disadvantages when retiring early due to organizational arrangement, not a standard pension regime or privilege.
* Comparing it to unemployment insurance is inappropriate; this policy ensures harmonious benefits and stable livelihoods for those leaving to help streamline the apparatus more effectively.
* It demonstrates the responsibility of the Party and State in ensuring the rights of those affected by the streamlining process.

**14. On Political Renovation:**

**Allegation:** Claims that Vietnam only renovates the economy but not politics; maintains an authoritarian leadership apparatus; demands the implementation of "separation of powers."
* Economic renovation has been combined with political renovation from the very beginning (economy is central, Party building is key).
* Political renovation must be conducted step-by-step and cautiously to maintain political stability—a prerequisite for development.
* State power is unified, with division, coordination, and control among branches (not separation of powers), which suits Vietnam's practical conditions.
* Building a Socialist Rule of Law State is a significant theoretical and practical development in reforming the political system.

**Allegation:** Distorts that "the Party does the State's job", encroaches on, and neutralizes the management role of the State.
* The operating mechanism is "Party leads, State manages, People own." The Party leads through guidelines, policies, and personnel work, not by doing the specific work of the State.
* The Party operates within the framework of the Constitution and the law; Party leadership ensures the State operates in the right direction, more effectively and efficiently.

**Allegation:** Claims that renovation in Vietnam is "half-hearted" because it only reforms the economy, not politics; economic development is slow due to political institutions holding it back.
* Political and economic renovation are conducted synchronously, with economic renovation as the center and political renovation taken step-by-step firmly.
* Huge economic achievements after 40 years of renovation (high growth, deep integration) refute the argument of "holding back" or "inefficiency."
* Political stability is a prerequisite for economic growth; "pluralist" models in some countries cause instability and do not guarantee development.

**15. On Democracy and Human Rights:**

**Allegation:** Claims that there is no democracy in Vietnam and human rights are violated; exploits democracy and human rights issues to attack the Party's leadership.
* The mechanism "Party leads, State manages, People own" correctly resolves social relationships and ensures the people's mastery.
* The yardstick for democracy and human rights is economic development, social stability, improved living standards, and the country's affirmed position.
* Political parties worldwide and the international community acknowledge Vietnam's position and achievements, refuting these distorted allegations.

**Allegation:** Relies on biased reports from foreign organizations (like HRW, RSF, etc.) to accuse Vietnam of lacking democracy, suppressing human rights, and arresting "dissidents" or "independent journalists".
* These reports are often based on one-sided, false information from hostile elements, ignoring the reality of freedom and legal protections in Vietnam.
* Vietnam's election to the UN Human Rights Council (2023-2025) with high votes reflects the international community's trust and recognition.
* Vietnam only prosecutes those who violate the law or abuse democratic freedoms to infringe upon the interests of the State and citizens, not for "political opinions".

**16. On the Amendment of the 2013 Constitution (2025):**

**Allegation:** Distorts that the Constitution amendment is an "internal power struggle", "consolidation of power", or an "unconstitutional" act; claims that "the people were not informed and did not participate".
* The purpose of the amendment is to serve national development, streamline the apparatus (two-tier government), and promote the people's mastery, not for power struggles.
* The amendment strictly adhered to Article 120 of the 2013 Constitution and legal processes (National Assembly decision, public consultation), ensuring constitutionality and democracy.
* The public consultation process was conducted openly, transparently, and widely (via VNeID app, conferences) with high participation and consensus from society.
* The amendment facilitates strong decentralization, reduces intermediate levels, and increases local autonomy, refuting allegations of "centralization of power".

**17. On the 14th National Party Congress (Personnel and Documents):**

**Allegation:** Fabricates rumors of "internal fighting", "factional purges", and "regional discrimination" in high-level personnel planning. Distorts draft documents as "old wine in new bottles", "unrealistic", or "hiding limitations".
* Personnel planning is conducted democratically, transparently, and strategically to select capable and virtuous leaders, not based on "factions" or "regions".
* Personnel are selected based on virtue, talent, and prestige for the national interest; there is no regional discrimination or "localism" as alleged.
* Rumors of "infighting" are malicious fabrications aimed at causing division and instability.
* The personnel process strictly follows regulations (Directive 35), ensuring democracy from the bottom up; replacing disciplined officials is a normal activity to ensure leadership quality, not a "purge".
* Draft documents are scientifically prepared with wide public consultation to ensure they reflect reality and the people's aspirations.

**Allegation:** Spreads fake "personnel lists," claims of "selling seats," "bribery," and smears the private lives of candidates before the Congress.
* These are "black media" tactics and "old tricks" aimed at creating information chaos and sowing doubt about the transparency of personnel work.
* Personnel work is prepared thoroughly, strictly through many rounds and steps, impartially and objectively; ensuring no opportunists are included while not missing talented individuals.
* Spreading false information is a violation of the law, harming political stability; citizens need to be alert and filter for official information.

**18. On Populism:**

**Allegation:** Exploits crowd psychology, uses demagogic slogans and empty promises to lure the masses, attacks the government, and divides the people from the Party.
* Populism often offers simplistic solutions to complex problems, lacking practicality and sustainability.
* Its essence is a political ploy by opportunists to vie for power, causing social instability.
* It is necessary to be alert and identify these tactics, avoiding being swayed by empty promises that incite social conflict.

**19. On Land Ownership:**

**Allegation:** Demands land privatization, claiming public ownership is "ownerless" and hinders economic development; distorts land disputes to incite opposition.
* Land is a special national resource and a crucial resource for development, belonging to the entire people with the State acting as the representative owner.
* This ownership regime prevents land accumulation by a few, prevents the impoverishment of farmers, and ensures equitable access to land.
* The State protects land use rights; disputes are resolved according to the law, not due to the nature of the ownership regime.

**20. On "Civil Disobedience":**

**Allegation:** Calls for "civil disobedience," illegal protests, and obstruction of public authority under the guise of "patriotism," "environmental protection," or "social criticism."
* This is a tactic of "color revolutions" or "street revolutions" aimed at disrupting security and order, leading to riots and subversion.
* All acts in the name of freedom and democracy that violate the law and infringe upon the interests of the State and citizens must be dealt with.
* Social criticism must be constructive and compliant with the Constitution and laws, not opposition or sabotage.

**Allegation:** Uses the guise of "patriotism" to incite protests and riots (such as the 2018 Binh Thuan incident, opposing administrative mergers); accuses the government of "selling out the country" when handling these rioters.
* True patriotism must be based on understanding and respect for the law, contributing to the country's stability and development.
* Acts of vandalism, resisting law enforcement, and disturbing public order are violations of the law that tarnish the country's image and must be condemned and strictly punished.

**21. On the Working Class in Industry 4.0:**

**Allegation:** Claims that in the 4.0 era, AI and robots replace humans, so the working class will disappear and lose its historical mission.
* Industry 4.0 changes the structure and methods of labor but does not eliminate the working class; the modern working class is becoming intellectualized.
* The working class remains the leading productive force, representing advanced modes of production and is the core force in building Socialism.

**22. On Religion and Ethnicity (Southwest Region and Nationwide):**

**Allegation:** Falsely accuses Vietnam of suppressing religion and discriminating against ethnic groups; incites separatism and autonomy (such as "Khmer Krom State", "Dega Protestantism"); exploits human rights issues to intervene internally.
* Vietnam is a multi-ethnic, multi-religious nation; its consistent policy is great national unity and freedom of belief and religion.
* All religions and ethnic groups are equal and develop together; the material and spiritual life of ethnic minority areas is constantly being improved.
* Resolutely fight against reactionary organizations that abuse the guise of "ethnicity" and "religion" to divide the great national unity and conduct terrorist or separatist activities.
* Refute the claim of "two religious policies" (one for show, one for suppression) or the "beg-give" mechanism for minorities; support policies are developmental investments, not favors.

**Allegation:** Exploits religious "online phenomena" (like the Thich Minh Tue case) or individual misconduct to accuse the government of obstructing freedom of belief and suppressing practitioners.
* The intervention of authorities is to ensure security, order, social safety, and the lives of citizens, not to prohibit belief.
* It is necessary to distinguish clearly between genuine religious practice and the abuse of belief to cause trouble, profiteer, or sabotage ("clickbait", incitement).
* The consistent policy is to respect freedom of belief but law must be upheld; any abuse will be handled.

**23. On Natural Disaster Prevention, Control, and Search and Rescue:**

**Allegation:** Distorts that "man-made disasters exceed natural ones," blaming all damages on the Party and State; falsely accuses the government of being "insensitive," "abandoning the people," and "prohibiting charity"; claims the armed forces' rescue efforts are just "staging" or "performance."
* Natural disasters are objective, force majeure phenomena affecting all nations (including developed ones). Blaming the regime is a politicization of disasters, irrational and inhumane.
* Disaster prevention is a strategic task enshrined in law (Law on Civil Defense, Law on Natural Disaster Prevention...) with the motto "prevention is better than cure," prioritizing human life above all.
* The Government always directs decisively and timely upon news of storms or floods; functional forces and local authorities are always on standby to evacuate and support the people; there is no "abandonment."
* The armed forces (Military, Police) are the core, shock troops on the front lines, disregarding danger to save people, demonstrating the nature of "serving the people," absolutely not "staging."
* The State always encourages and honors the spirit of "mutual affection," creating conditions for lawful charitable activities; the claim of "prohibition" is a fabrication aimed at dividing the great national unity.

**Allegation:** Spreads fake news about dam failures, or claims disasters are "heaven's punishment" or due to "bad feng shui" of the regime; casts doubt on the transparency of relief efforts by the Fatherland Front.
* Natural disasters are objective, extreme events due to climate change; superstitious attributions are malicious tactics to cause panic and incite opposition.
* The allocation of support resources is conducted publicly and transparently according to the law; fake news spreading or charity fraud is strictly punished.
* The reality of officers and soldiers sacrificing their lives or being injured to save people powerfully refutes claims of "acting" or "making a show."

**Allegation:** Twists concepts, claiming that officers and soldiers helping the people is a "favor" or "grace" rather than a responsibility; accuses the government of being "passive," forcing people to "cry for help."
* Saving people is a command from the heart, the nature of the armed forces, and a public duty, not a "favor" or grace.
* The sacrifice of many officers and soldiers during floods is the clearest proof of the spirit of "sacrificing oneself for the people," refuting the callousness of distorted arguments.
* Vietnam is always proactive in disaster prevention plans; the evacuation and rescue of tens of thousands of people is a massive effort of the entire political system, not "passivity."

**24. On Building Culture:**

**Allegation:** Claims that the policy of building an advanced culture imbued with national identity is "unrealistic", "formalistic", "demagogic"; that the Party does not truly care about developing culture and people.
* Building culture is a strategic goal, both a driving force and a spiritual foundation of society, concretized through many Resolutions and achieving great achievements (heritage preservation, human cultural development).
* Traditional and modern cultural values are harmoniously combined, creating endogenous strength for the country, not empty words.
* Struggle against hybrid, depraved cultural trends or the abuse of "creative freedom" to oppose the regime and go against good customs and traditions.

**25. On Education and Training:**

**Allegation:** Denies educational achievements, claims the education system is "degraded", "ruined", driven only by "achievement disease"; distorts international articles praising Vietnamese education.
* International organizations (World Bank, The Economist) highly rate the progress and efficiency of Vietnam's education relative to income levels.
* Education is a top national policy with priority investment; universal education rates are high, and Vietnamese students achieve high results in international competitions.
* Limitations are being addressed; isolated incidents cannot be used to categorize the nature of the entire education system.

**Allegation:** Exploits foreign visa policies (e.g., US student visas) to distort diplomatic relations or disparage domestic education, claiming people are "fleeing" abroad.
* Studying abroad is a legitimate need in a globalized world and does not imply a rejection of domestic education.
* Adjustments to visa policies are internal matters of other nations and do not reflect diplomatic rifts. Domestic education is constantly innovating and integrating.

**26. On Freedom of Speech and Cyberspace:**

**Allegation:** Abuses "freedom of speech" to insult individuals and attack the judiciary (claims "justice is a comedian"); asserts that the Cybersecurity Law suppresses freedom.
* Freedom of speech must be within the legal framework and must not infringe upon the interests of the State or citizens.
* It is necessary to fight against "dirty media," fake news, and the use of social media to mislead public opinion and cause instability.
* Handling violations in cyberspace is necessary to protect social order and human rights, not to suppress freedom.

**27. On History and Major Holidays:**

**Allegation:** Distorts the significance of the August Revolution and National Day (Sep 2); claims independence did not bring freedom or happiness; calls for a "revision" of history.
* The August Revolution and National Day opened an era of independence and freedom, a brilliant milestone for the nation.
* Achievements after more than 35 years of renovation prove the value of independence associated with Socialism.
* Denying history is an act of ingratitude towards the sacrifices of ancestors, going against national interests.

**Allegation:** Claims that organizing parades (such as for National Day or Dien Bien Phu) is a "waste of tax money," "formalistic," and a useless "show of force" in peacetime.
* Commemorative activities are not just rituals but occasions to educate on patriotic traditions, strengthening trust and great national unity.
* Costs are calculated economically and within budget. The spiritual value, national pride, and deterrent power (demonstrating readiness to defend the Fatherland) are immense benefits that cannot be measured solely in economic terms.

**28. On Party Discipline and Party Member Regulations:**

**Allegation:** Distorts regulations on what Party members are forbidden to do (e.g., ban on foreign nationality, foreign assets); claims the Party "stands above the law" and regulations are "unconstitutional".
* Party members are vanguards and must be subject to stricter discipline than ordinary citizens to ensure integrity and loyalty.
* The regulations aim to prevent degradation, "self-evolution," and corruption (asset concealment), fully aligning with the goal of building a clean Party.
* The Party operates within the framework of the Constitution and the law; internal Party regulations do not contradict the law but impose stricter ethical requirements on Party members.

**29. On the National Assembly and Elections:**

**Allegation:** Claims that elections in Vietnam are "Party chooses, people elect," merely formalistic and pre-arranged; asserts the National Assembly has no real power, acting as a "rubber stamp."
* Elections are conducted according to universal, equal, direct, and secret principles; the consultation process ensures structure and quality, but the final decision belongs to the voters' ballots.
* The Party introducing personnel is the responsibility of the ruling party to ensure leadership quality, not replacing the people's right to choose (there are surplus candidates and self-nominees).
* The National Assembly exercises constitutional and legislative powers, supreme supervision, and decides on important issues (high-level personnel, budget, major projects); questioning activities and votes of confidence are becoming increasingly substantive.

**Allegation:** Calls for "election boycotts," "not voting," or casting "blank votes"; claims that elections lack democracy so participation is unnecessary.
* Boycotting elections is voluntarily giving up the sacred right to mastery of citizens, showing indifference to the country's destiny.
* High voter turnout in elections demonstrates the trust and will of the entire people; calls for boycotts are plots to sabotage national unity.
* Voting is a legal right and obligation, contributing to selecting worthy people to represent the people's will.

**Allegation:** Accuses the government of "suppressing self-nominated candidates" or "blocking independent candidates"; claims only Party members can run for office.
* The law stipulates that all citizens meeting the standards have the right to run for office; there is no discrimination.
* "Self-nominated" cases are rejected because they do not meet legally prescribed standards (qualities, capacity, trust at residence) or have violated the law, using elections for sabotage.
* The consultation process is organized publicly and democratically for voters to screen and select those who truly have sufficient virtue and talent.

**30. On Sea and Island Sovereignty:**

**Allegation:** Distorts that the Party and State are "weak," "compromising" with major powers, or ignoring the East Sea (South China Sea) sovereignty issue in exchange for economic or political benefits.
* Vietnam resolutely and persistently protects sovereignty and sovereign rights through peaceful means, based on international law (UNCLOS 1982).
* The policy is "both cooperating and struggling," maintaining a peaceful environment for development but never making concessions on territorial sovereignty.
* The strength to protect sovereignty is the combined strength of the entire nation, combined with the strength of the times and international support, not through provocative actions or miscalculated military confrontation.

**Allegation:** Distorts the "Four Nos" defense policy as self-isolation or "tying one's own hands"; accuses Vietnam of depending on foreign countries or "making backroom deals" to trade sovereignty.
* The "Four Nos" policy is the highest expression of the line of independence and autonomy, helping Vietnam avoid being drawn into military alliances or great power conflicts.
* Vietnam engages in defense cooperation openly and transparently with countries based on national interests, without depending on anyone.

**31. On Decree 168/2024/ND-CP (Traffic Violation Penalties):**

**Allegation:** Distorts that increasing fines under Decree 168 is merely a tool to "maximize budget collection," "bleed the people dry," or "benefit the Police force"; claims that traffic lights are "traps" to fine people unjustly.
* The main objective is to raise awareness, ensure safety, and prevent the "disregard for the law" mentality; fines are remitted to the State budget for infrastructure and safety, not "shared" among the Police.
* Traffic Police affirm that objective errors (faulty lights) are not penalized; the process involves camera verification to ensure fairness.
* Strict penalties are a deterrent against intentional violations; if citizens obey the law, they pay nothing.

**Allegation:** Claims that strict enforcement causes traffic congestion and that the fines are unreasonable compared to income.
* Congestion is due to infrastructure and vehicle density; strict adherence to the law actually improves traffic flow and reduces accidents (proven by statistics reducing deaths and injuries).
* "Hitting the pocketbook" is a necessary measure to change bad habits; civilized nations use strict laws to ensure order.
* The safety of life and property of the people is the highest priority; ignoring the law leads to tragic consequences that money cannot fix.

**32. On New Tax Policies and Electronic Invoices:**

**Allegation:** Claims the State "abandons lump-sum tax, leaving people no way to survive," "maximizes collection," "imposes tax upon tax," or "forces households to become enterprises."
* Switching from lump-sum tax to tax based on actual revenue (electronic invoices) ensures fairness and transparency among business entities.
* Tax rates have not increased; this is an inevitable step in international integration, helping to avoid trade barriers and economic sanctions.
* Preventing tax loss provides the State with resources to reinvest in infrastructure, healthcare, education, and social welfare.
* Contributes to eliminating counterfeit and smuggled goods, protecting the interests of consumers and genuine businesses.

**33. On the "New Era - Era of the Nation's Rise":**

**Allegation:** Claims the concept of a "New Era" is "vague," "subjective," "illusory," or lacks a practical basis for realization.
* The "New Era" has clear connotations: an era of breakthrough development, prosperity, people's well-being, and the country standing shoulder-to-shoulder with great powers.
* Solid practical basis rests on the immense achievements after 40 years of Renovation (economic scale and international position have never been greater).
* This is the moment of convergence of favorable factors (opportunities from Industry 4.0, geopolitical position, national aspiration) to create a leap forward.
* Frank identification of bottlenecks (institutions, infrastructure, human resources) to provide breakthrough solutions demonstrates a scientific approach, not subjective will.

**34. On Universal Free Tuition Policy:**

**Allegation:** Distorts it as a "populist trick," "patchwork solution," or fabricates that "tuition is free but public school quotas are cut to push students to private schools."
* This is a humane policy reflecting the superior nature of the regime, realizing the goal of "leaving no one behind" in education.
* Vietnam is the first nation in ASEAN to waive tuition through high school, demonstrating significant effort despite budget constraints.
* In reality, public enrollment quotas and the number of newly built schools have increased (e.g., in Hanoi, HCMC), completely refuting the claim of "pushing to private schools."
* The policy brings practical benefits, reducing the financial burden for millions of families and motivating poor students to attend school.

**35. On Emission Reduction and Gasoline Vehicle Restriction Policies (Green Transition):**

**Allegation:** Claims that banning gasoline vehicles is "robbing the poor of their livelihood," "forcing the people," and hindering travel; asserts that gasoline vehicles are vital assets and banning them leaves people with no recourse.
* This is a correct policy aimed at protecting public health against severe air pollution (Hanoi's PM2.5 pollution is 9 times the WHO recommendation, with vehicles accounting for 70% of emissions).
* The transition has a specific roadmap, piloted step-by-step (in Ring Road 1 from 2026), and is not implemented abruptly or extremely on a large scale immediately.
* The Government and the city have practical support policies: support for exchanging old vehicles, incentives on registration fees and license plates for electric vehicles, and development of public transport to provide people with alternative choices.
* The ultimate goal is for the community's benefit, protecting the living environment for future generations, not to trouble the people.

**Allegation:** Distorts that this policy is "collusion" between the Government and businesses (like VinFast) to sell electric vehicles; forcing people to buy cars from a specific manufacturer.
* The electric vehicle market is an open, equal playing field with many domestic and foreign brands competing; people have the right to choose a suitable car brand, and no one is forced to buy from VinFast.
* Preferential policies (charging station infrastructure, taxes/fees) apply generally to green vehicle types, not exclusively to any single enterprise.
* Businesses launching vehicle exchange support programs is a normal business activity aligned with the general policy, contributing to accelerating the green transition.

**Allegation:** Claims that banning gasoline vehicles violates citizens' "freedom of movement"; obstructing the right to earn a living.
* Freedom of movement is not restricted; people can still travel by public transport or green vehicles. Restricting polluting vehicles in specific areas is a necessary administrative management measure to protect the common interest (clean environment).
* The Constitution and international law do not stipulate that freedom of movement equates to the right to use any type of vehicle that harms the community.
* Developing green transport helps reduce dependence on imported gasoline and saves operating costs for people and society in the long run.

**36. On Protecting Historical Figures and Historical Truth:**

**Allegation:** Distorts, smears, and "revises" the contributions of historical figures and national heroes (such as Le Van Duyet, Phan Thanh Gian, the Nguyen Dynasty...); labeling them as "sinners" or "traitors" based on extreme, unhistorical viewpoints.
* Evaluating historical figures must be placed within the specific context of their era. The contributions of ancestors in opening up lands and defending borders are undeniable truths.
* Smearing historical figures is a counter-cultural act, showing ingratitude ("drinking water but forgetting the source"), hurting national sentiment, and is strictly prohibited by law.

**37. On Salary Reform (Roadmap from 2026):**

**Allegation:** Distorts the policy of increasing the base salary and wage reform in 2026 as "demagoguery," causing "high inflation," or "prices rising before wages do"; claims the State "abandons" freelance workers.
* Wage reform is an investment in human resources, enabling officials and public servants to live on their salaries, thereby reducing petty corruption and improving service quality for the people.
* The Government has price management scenarios to control inflation. Along with raising public sector wages, the State also adjusts regional minimum wages to protect workers in the business sector.
